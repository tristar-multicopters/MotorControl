# GNR_firmware
Repository for Ganrunner firmware 
WE decided to use the Flexible Software Package (FSP) for Renesas RA MCU Family, version 3.7.0.
The 1 reason is our MCUboot, from Renesas FSP, doesn't work on version 3.8.0 and change to version 4.0.0 or more 
require a lot of changes.
Version 3.7.0 has averything we need to continue our developement.
You can download FSP 3.7.0 here:
