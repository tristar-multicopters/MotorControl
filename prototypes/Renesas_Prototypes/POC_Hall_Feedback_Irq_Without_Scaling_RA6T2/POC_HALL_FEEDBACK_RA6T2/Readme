This project is an incremental build to three phase PWM project 

Hall signals are connected to pins PC10,PC11 and PA12. All these pins are configured as external interrupt pins with CLK/64 filter. 
Interrupt service routines associated with these external interrupt are not used. Events generated by detection of rise/fall of signal are used as source of timer capture. 
Timer 3 is configured to capture timer value and generate HALL_TIMx_CC_IRQHandler interrupt. Same timer is configured to overflow at measurement of 65535 and generate HALL_TIMx_UP_IRQHandler interrupt.   
HALL_TIMx_CC_IRQHandler identifies state, uses measurement to calculate average electrical speed.
HALL_TIMx_UP_IRQHandler counts the number of timer overflows that happened between two sucessive state change.
HALL_Init initializes the timer configuration using renesas API.
   
Angle calculation for PWM is calculated in end of ADC conversion ISR. This calculated angle is scaled to physically visualize it through DAC connected to pin PA06.
