1. Overview: We are making the POC of reading a Pulse signal periode using 2 reference projects

2. Project 1 Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the the functionality of GPT Input capture module .
        GPT7 is used to generate PWM signal of 100msec for 50% ratio and provided as input to GPT Input capture(GPT1).
	  GPT1 counts the event pulse received at its input. Based on the period and capture event, 
	  the time period of pulse is calculated and displayed on RTTViewer. An ICU interrupt module was added to the main
	  code for an input read interruption

3. Project 2 Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the the functionality of GPT Input capture module .
        GPT7 is used to generate PWM signal of 100msec for 50% ratio and provided as input to GPT low power 
	  Input capture(GPT0). GPT0 counts the event pulse received at its input. 
        Based on the period and capture event, the time period of pulse is calculated and displayed on RTTViewer.

4. Hardware settings for the project:
        Hardware connections:
		2. PWM Output	= PE10
		   Capture Input	= PE12
		   ICU Input	= PA10

		1. PWM Output 	= PC08
		   Capture Input 	= PA08

5. Conclusion
The Low power Timer demande the use of two pins compared to the normal one
The use of the low power Timer is easier in the configuration
