1. Overview: We are making the POC of reading a Pulse signal periode using 2 reference projects

2. Project 1 Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the the functionality of GPT Input capture module .
        GPT7 is used to generate PWM signal of 100msec for 50% ratio and provided as input to GPT Input capture(GPT1).
	  GPT1 counts the event pulse received at its input. Based on the period and capture event, 
	  the time period of pulse is calculated. An ICU interrupt module was added to the main
	  code for an input read interruption

3. Project 2 Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the functionality of AGT Input capture module .
        GPT7 is used to generate PWM signal of 100msec for 50% ratio and provided as input to AGT low power 
	  Input capture(AGT0). AGT0 counts the event pulse received at its input. 
        Based on the period and capture event, the time period of pulse is calculated.

4. Hardware settings for the project:
        Hardware connections:
		P1. PWM Output	= PE10
		    Capture Input	= PE12
		    ICU Input	= PA10

		P2. PWM Output 	= PC08
		    Capture Input = PA08

5. Conclusion
The Low Power Timer AGT demand the use of two pins compared to the normal one or it will return you an error in 
the configuaration pins setup. The use of the low power Timer AGT is easier in the configuration. Both timer have 
the same behaviour and functions for pulse reading.
